# Potion HUD Hider
## Information
As requested from my Discord, this pack removes the squares that shows you what potion effects you currently have applied at the side of your screen. This is mainly useful for mobile players who don't want to accidentally keep tapping it.
## Download
You can download this pack from my website: https://TheAlienDoctor.com <br>
You can also view the changelog, showcase video and any other information there.
## How does it work?
It works by simply removing the effects render in the json ui for the HUD screen.
## Contributing
Anyone is free to contribute via a pull request. If you feel you have a good new feature, it is recommended to contact Alien before spending time creating it in case Alien decides it doesn't fit. <b>
If you aren't sure where to start, then maybe check the issues tab for some bugs you might be able to fix? </b>
Any and all contributions are welcome and appreciated!
